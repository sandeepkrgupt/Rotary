If you do 
> git reset --hard HEAD 
> git reset --hard <SOME-COMMIT>  , SOME-COMMIT = Yuor commit ID which you can get by "git log"
then Git will:

Make your current branch (typically master) back to point at <SOME-COMMIT>.
Then make the files in your working tree and the index ("staging area") the same as the versions committed in <SOME-COMMIT>.
